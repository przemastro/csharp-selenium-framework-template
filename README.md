# csharpSelenium2vsSelenium3

C# + Nunit + Selenium WebDriver 2/3 + Specflow

This is a demo version of framework used for UI testing. Created in the Page Object pattern style. In fact this is a 3 in 1 framework. I wanted to verify how easy is to switch between selenium 2 and selenium 3. I also presemt two different approaches of page object pattern framework.

Selenium3 framework
